                <h3>Project overview</h3>
                <p>The client, Yolanda Lopez, owns Sit Conmigo, an ethical, sustainable chair company. She's looking for a new website in preparation for the launch of her new chair collection, in order to promote interest in and allow customers to pre-order the collection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Project scope</h3>
                <p>Deliverables for this project included a color palette, font pairing and typography guide, and responsive web design featuring mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. Deliverables were created using Adobe XD and were delivered in their original format and as PNGs.</p>

                <h3>Project role</h3>
                <p>I received a project brief from the client and created the deliverables from that information. As the client was fictional, there was no direct communication with the client, but I did frequently seek out and receive feedback from others throughout the process.</p>

            <h2>The Process</h2>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Project goals</h3>
                <p>From a business perspective, Yolanda wanted it to be easy for her customers to view and pre-order her chairs, but it goes beyond money for her. She's passionate about her impact on the world around her, which inspired her to prioritize sustainable, ethical production and the positive impact it has on both the planet and the people who work for her. Understandably, she wants this to shine through in her website - it's a major selling point for her chairs that easily justifies the increased cost over similar chairs produced less sustainably or ethically.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Initial branding</h3>
                <p>As I brainstormed how to bring Yolanda's values to life through her website, I realized that we currently have more conversations and imagery around the impact of products on the environment, rather than their impact on the people producing them. Sit Conmigo values and prioritizes both of these things, of course, but its customers would be more primed to identify with and look closer at the brand if the website visually leaned into imagery associated with environmentalism. The copy would then have the opportunity to bring in Sit Conmigo's commitment to fair labor in a context where it would be a further selling point.</p>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>One of the most enduring images associated with environmentalism is plant life, so I immediately looked into color schemes centering green. Yolanda specifically asked that the website not overshadow her products, so I kept it simple, picking a pale, almost sage green background color that would bring character and uniqueness to the site without being too vibrant. I reinforced it with a dark green secondary color for the headers, buttons, and icons, and a terra cotta orange accent color for a floating call-to-action bar that would invite customers to preorder her chairs. I also ensured that the shades of the three colors would be accessible in all color combinations I would use in the design; while accessibility was not a part of Yolanda's brief, I knew that an inaccessible website would contradict her fair labor message, and thus should be avoided at all costs.</p>
                    <div class="case-study-image no-bottom">
                        <img src="../img/sc-art-and-soil-bangalore-znakfs7IGQI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Succulents in terra cotta pots on a white table against a pale green bactround" id="inspo-plants" />

                </div>
                <p>When selecting fonts, I leaned towards a sans-serif main font that would echo the clean, smooth lines of the logo, and ended up deciding on Montserrat. Its consistent line thickness, kerning, and spacing would bring a note of dependability to the design. I paired it with Yeseva One for headers and branding - the serif font pairs chunky and thinner strokes within letters and occasionally utilizes small flourishes that break up the otherwise more conservative font. The final font pairing is steady and reliable, leaning on tradition but unafraid to take a bold step in the right direction, and perfectly encapsulates Sit Conmigo.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <h3>Wireframe creation</h3>
                <p>From the very beginning planning stages, I knew how the design would start - with an eye-catching floating header, inviting customers to pre-order a chair. I've seen them on many websites and find them very effective, so I knew it would be a good way to prime customers to make a pre-order purchase further down the page, especially when colored with the bright terracotta orange against the more sedate green I had planned for the background. A more traditional header below the pre-order bar would feature the logo and a hamburger menu for the navigation links, which would save space and limit distractions on the mobile design.</p>
                <div class="column-mobile">
                    <div class="stack">
                        <p>Next, an image slideshow would meet many design needs simultaneously; it would show off some of the designs, building interest, while also introducing Yolanda herself without taking too much focus away from her designs. An About section below the slideshow would introduce the brand and its values, further building identification with and interest in the company. By the end of this section, customers would know why they should buy a chair from Sit Conmigo in particular, and were ready to be officially introduced to the chairs themselves.</p>
                        <p class="no-bottom">The Pre-order section would show off the chairs with large images and minimal text; while more information about each design could be shared on an individual order page linked to the "Preorder Now!" button, the focus here should be on the image and the design itself. This would also force the customer to make a small commitment - clicking on the button - in order to view further details and the price, reducing the commitment associated with preordering the chair and thus smoothing the way for a sale. A minimalistic Contact section with details and social media icons follows, but doesn't distract the customer from the above sections unless they're specifically looking for it; as with the rest of the design, the focus remains with the chairs themselves.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <div class="scaled">
                            <img src="../img/sc-sketch-mobile.jpeg" alt="A mobile website's pen-and-paper wireframe" id="sketch-mobile" />

                <div class="column-mobile">
                    <p>In adapting the mobile wireframe for tablets, I balanced expanding some elements with instituting a two-column layout in others in order to create a seamless transition and make the best use of the increased space. The header's hamburger menu expands into a list of navigation links with the increased space, to make navigation easier for customers. I also expanded the image slideshow to take up more space, increasing its visual impact as customers navigate onto the page; the About section remains below, filling the width of the page. The Preorder section images move into two columns; with the larger image size allowed by the tablet, this doesn't reduce the impact, but rather increases the chance that customers will see all of the designs while scrolling, and thus makes them more likely to be caught by one and make a purchase. Finally, the Contact section also moves into two columns, leaving the Preorder section still firmly on the screen while viewing the Contact section and thus increasing the chance of a sale.</p>
                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <div class="scaled">

                <div class="column-mobile">
                    <p>Finally, I created a desktop version of the design. As with the tablet design, image and text sizes increased, filling the increased space. I only made one change to the layout in this design; I moved the image slideshow and About section into the two column layout seen in the other sections. This kept the image slideshow from getting too big or distracting from the preorders below, while keeping the image slideshow on the left side of the screen ensured that its still the first thing customers see as they navigate to the site, instantly catching their attention and drawing them in.</p>

                <h3>Design comps</h3>
                <div class="column">
                    <p>My next step was to turn the pen-and-paper wireframes into digital designs. I started off by importing the images into Adobe XD, overlaying them over a canvas, and starting to add placeholders of the design elements. After some consideration, I determined that the best method for creating the four identical displays for Yolanda's designs was to create one display and then duplicate it. This ensured that the formatting for each display would be identical, as it would be when formatted by the developer.</p>
                    <div class="case-study-image no-bottom">
                        <div class="scaled">
                            <img src="../img/sc-wireframe.png" alt="A basic digital wireframe of mobile, tablet, and desktop designs" id="wireframe" />
                        </div>
                        <p class="label">Basic digital wireframes of the mobile, tablet, and desktop designs</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I then began adding the design elements to the page, starting with the mobile design. Adding the images immediately revealed an unexpected issue and forced me to reconsider my approach, though – when I'd generated the placeholders for the images, I hadn't taken into account the size and shape of the image, or how the image's subject was placed. The image of the white chair was the most restrictive image – tall and narrow, and with the image's full width taken up by the chair – so I started there, finding the image proportions that would incorporate the chair's full height within the width I'd set aside for the image slideshow on each design. I then created thumbnail images with the same proportions from the other slideshow images.</p>
                <p>The pre-order displays for the four chair designs required a different set of proportions, in order to best show off the green and red patterned chairs, which were much taller and skinnier than the white chair was. I limited the height of the mobile design's images, in order to reduce the amount of scrolling needed to see all the images and thus the chance that a user wouldn't get to the later designs, but I took advantage of the tablet and desktop designs' grid layout to use longer images that showed off the chairs' full designs. Once the images were all masked to the proper size, I created and then duplicated a display tile for each design, in order to ensure that the spacing would remain identical between display tiles on the same design.</p>
                <p>I then created the contact section on the mobile form using a combination of XD design elements and FontAwesome icons, and then copied the section over onto the tablet and desktop pages in order to ensure consistency between the designs. Finally, I reviewed the design for look and feel, accessibility, and accordance with the brief, and then sent the final design to Yolanda for her review and approval.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge in this project came while adapting the initial wireframes into high-fidelity designs. While creating the image placeholders, I had based their proportions on what looked good and fit with the design, not on the images themselves, which created a conflict when I inserted the images; when sized and masked to fit the placeholders, they didn't show off the images' subjects as well as they could or should. I solved the problem by leaving behind the original image proportions and instead developing new proportions that focused on showing off the most restrictive images' subjects. In the future, the best solution would be to determine the best image proportions before creating the digital wireframe, but that requires having the images early in the design process; if the images are not available at that stage or if they change during the design process, the technique I used would allow for an existing design to be modified to fit the new images with minimal delay.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="case-study-section">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The website design brought the client's brand to life, showing off her chairs to their advantage and enticing site visitors to preorder. The client was very happy with the design, feeling that it met all of her needs, and she passed the design on to her developer to turn it into a functional webpage so she could start sharing her chairs with the world.</p>
